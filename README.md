# PaperStitcher

PaperStitcher is a creative and powerful wallpaper editing tool. It was designed to be an easy way to use different wallpapers on seperate screens in multi-monitor setups. However, PaperStitcher is well suited for single monitor use as well. It has the ability to layout any number of images per screen and freely transform them. It can also shuffle the images and automatically generate you a new wallpaper at set intervals. PaperStitcher is also equipped to customize the logon screen on Windows 7.

For laptop users, PaperStitcher automatically loads and saves layouts for different monitor configurations. For example, if you were to plug in a projector into your laptop, PaperStitcher will save your current layout, and create a one for you which you can then customize. Once you unplug the projector PaperStitcher will revert your wallpaper back to the previous layout you had. This functionality is very useful for people on the move and those who may need to make professional presentations.
